`grove_ultrasonic`
====================================================

A CircuitPython library for the Grove ultrasonic range sensor.
Based on the CircuitPython library for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic range sensor.

The HC-SR04 functions by sending an ultrasonic signal, which is reflected by
many materials, and then sensing when the signal returns to the sensor. Knowing
that sound travels through dry air at `343.2 meters per second (at 20 °C)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound>`_, it's pretty straightforward
to calculate how far away the object is by timing how long the signal took to
go round-trip and do some simple arithmetic, which is handled for you by this
library.

  - ladyada - compatible with `distance` property standard, renaming, Pi compat
